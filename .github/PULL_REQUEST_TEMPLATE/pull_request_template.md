## Checklist for next release

- [ ] finish your development and merge it into the `develop` branch
- [ ] update documentation
- [ ] update / fix tests
- [ ] bump version numbers (in files `aiida_kkr/__init__.py`, `pyproject.toml`, `.bumpversion.cfg`)

If everything is done, you can merge your changes from `develop` back into `master` and create a tag for the new version number. Creating a new tag always  triggers publication to pypi (see `.github/workflows/cd.yml` for the definition of this github action).
