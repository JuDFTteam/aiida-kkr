    "The converted potentials files, which are retrieved, can be used e.g. to create a new structure by stacking preexisting structures and creating some defect containing supercell by replacing/adding some potential form another calculation with a different element. However, this  is in principle difficult as the Fermi levels of the individual potentials would have to align which they tend not to, if one mixes different calculations. A workaround that is to make use of the possibility to run CPA calculations with KKRhost. This way one can obtain a good starting potential with aligned Fermi levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To ensure the pronvenance of the input files, i. e. for good bookkeeping, it is helpful to store all the files together in a single object. This can be done using the `StrucWithPotData` datatype that comes with the plugin. Essentially this is just the fixed set of an AiiDA `StructureData` object a list of formatted potential files for the sites of the structure and a list of the shapes of the individual shapefunctions for the corresponding sites in the same order as the site list of the structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several ways how such a `StrucWithPotData` object can be created. The direct way is to provide the structure, the list of potential files, and the list of shapefunction files like so (here we use some files from the local file system, say from a run without AiiDA, bear in mind that shapes and potentials must match!):"
